# BlenderTest

Start discovering code better with EntryPoint.cs scripts.

You can add any amount of tasks/orders creating new Recipe ScriptaObjet instance and fill it with needed ScriptableObjects ingredients.

Each ingredient has ScriptaObject data, Prefab with Ingredient.cs script and a material with certain color. 
This materail should be used in Scriptable object data and in the MeshRenderer. 
It made this way to be easier to setup colors for orders and for meshes - so they visualy the same.

Added android build.

Doing refactoring in a separate branch. 
Created PR to see the difference.
Refactoring branch is not playable yet.
